## Coding style: <br>
Consistency in coding style is important throughout the project. We recommend following the official Python style guide (PEP 8).
Key points include:
- Indentation: Use consistent tabs or spaces to maintain readability.
- Line Length: Keep lines reasonably short; avoid exceeding half the width of notebook cells if applicable.
- Comments: Use # for comments and write them clearly to explain the code.
- Whitespace: Include proper spacing around operators, function arguments, and within control structures.
- Imports: Organize import statements in logical groups and in the recommended order (standard library, third-party packages, local modules).
## : Pull Request Process <br>
- It is recommended to create a Git branch for each pull request in order to maintain consistency.
- Code should follow the official python style guide
- We will be using Docstring for documentation.
- We use pytest (assert). Contributions with test cases included will be easier to accept since we can check erros better.
